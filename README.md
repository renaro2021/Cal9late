# Cal9late

The meaning of the name Cal9late with the 9 in the middle points out on it's pronounciation at Japanese. You normally pronounce 9 as "Ku / Kyu" therefore by reading it like that it just sounds like "Calculate" as a whole.

I took most of the code from my K3Tree project (you can also see that in my Github) and stripped it down to a modified version.

#Notes
The bugs I have noticed is that despite the program having a Multiline feature for the Character Displaying Field, you cannot scroll it so only the latest 2 lines will work. This has to do with how it is handled on Android and there seems to be a fix but complicated. I cannot promise a fix for it but I'm still taking a look in the case.
